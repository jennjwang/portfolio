          The Parking Meter Interface
        </span>
        <p>
          Steps away from the Keeney Quad and Plant City, the parking meters on
          South Main St. are a public interface located between Financial
          District and College Hill. The meters offer two payment methods –
          credit card or coins. There is a screen on the top of the meter, with
          buttons on both sides, and a strip of red, yellow, green, and clear
          tiny light bulbs inside the screen on the left. As users interact with
          the meters through the buttons, they scroll through the six displays
          shown below.

          Motivation
        </span>
        <p>
          My objective was to go out about in the real world, look at publicly
          accessible interfaces, and observe real users interacting with them. I
          interviewed these individuals about their experiences, created
          personas based on these users, and illustrated a storyboard for one of
          these personas. In stepping out of my own shoes, I recognized that
          different people have different needs and expectations when it comes
          to paying for parking.

              The sources of his experiences are highlighted in blue above from
              Marvin and Jack’s summaries. Marvin and Jack both experienced
              issues paying by card, as the parking meter was slow in its
              response to the payment method. In particular, Marvin encountered
              difficulties changing the time limit for his parking and was
              frustrated by the number of displays he had to scroll through
              while on a time crunch.

              Chloe is from out of state and she’s visiting Brown. It’s her
              first time parking in Providence.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              The problems she encounters with the interface include:
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  1) The interface doesn’t provide enough guidance for Chloe to
                  complete the process of paying by card. She is unfamiliar with
                  the interface and needs more instructions.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                </li>
                <li>
                  2) Chloe is unsure which parking meter corresponds to her
                  parking spot and can’t find that information on the interface.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                </li>
                <li>
                  3) Chloe can’t read the display because the screen is too dark
                  and the light is reflecting off of the screen.
                  <br></br>

              Chloe is primarily based on the users Jack and Susan. The sources
              of her experiences are highlighted in yellow above from Jack and
              Susan’s summaries. Jack and Susan are both parking in Providence
              for the first time, and many of their issues arise from an
              unfamiliarity with interface and revolve around the physical
              design of its features. However, because they are both unaware of
              the parking process in Providence, there were also features of the
              parking meter that they found useful.

            Sam walks up to the parking meter to pay for parking for 45 minutes.
            He presses the down arrow button to arrive at the time limit screen,
            as shown in the drawing.

            He tries to press the down arrow button to reduce the time limit for
            parking but instead the screen switches to display asking him to
            insert card payment. He tries to scroll back to the previous screen,
            but when he presses the down arrow button, the screen switches to
            the next one again.

            He plans, designs, and oversees the construction of buildings. To
            practice, architecture means to provide services in connection with
            the creation of buildings and the space within the site surrounding
            the buildings that have human occupancy or use as their purpose.

            He then inserts and removes his card repeatedly and continues
            pressing the buttons until finally the screen changed.

            <p className="-mt-10">
              The screens changed from displaying information regarding the
              maximum parking limit to the rate per hour to the enforced time
              limits (shown above). Sam continues pressing the down arrow button
              to scroll through these screens before arriving at the
              confirmation screen for his payment.

          Looking Back At It
        </span>
        Although walking up to strangers and asking for interviews was a
        daunting task, this project highlighted the importance of these
        interviews and the role of personas and storyboards in helping designers
        create understanding and empathy with the end-users. I really understood
        how personas can put a “face” to the user story and allow design to gain
        different perspectives. I also appreciated how storyboards helped me
        capture the experience of a user at the parking meter.
